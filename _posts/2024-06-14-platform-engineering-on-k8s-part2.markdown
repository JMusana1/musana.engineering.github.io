With the groundwork established in **[PART 1](https://musana.engineering/platform-engineering-on-k8s-part1/)**, Part 2 dives deeper into the implementation and integration of the key components that will power our platform's capabilities: Argo Events for event-driven automation, Argo Workflows for CI/CD pipelines, and FastAPI as the frontend API layer.

## Event-driven Automation
To add event-driven automation capabilities within our platform, we configure Argo Events to integrate with an event source and trigger automated Argo workflows. Our aim is to trigger a Workflow upon receiving an HTTP POST request from FastAPI, such as when a developer initiates a request to provision a new environment or deploy an application. To achieve this, we need to create the following resources in Kubernetes.

## EventBus
The **[EventBus](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-events/concepts/eventbus/)** resource acts as the transport layer within Argo Events, facilitating the communication between EventSources and Sensors. It serves as a central hub where EventSources publish events, and Sensors subscribe to those events to execute triggers and automated workflows. Argo Events supports three implementations of the EventBus: **NATS, Jetstream, and Kafka**. In our case, we are using the NATS implementation, which provides a lightweight and efficient messaging system for event distribution.

{% highlight javascript %}
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: EventBus
metadata:
  name: eventbus-nats
  namespace: argo-events
spec:
  nats:
    native:
      // Optional, defaults to 3. If it is < 3, set it to 3, that is the minimal requirement.
      replicas: 3
      // Optional, authen strategy, "none" or "token", defaults to "none"
      auth: token
{% endhighlight %}

In this configuration:
- We define an EventBus resource named **eventbus-nats** in the argo-events namespace.
- The **spec.nats.native** section specifies that we are using the NATS implementation of the EventBus.
- The **[spec.nats.replicas](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/)** field is set to 3
- The **spec.nats.auth** field is set to **token**, enabling token-based authentication for secure communication between EventSources, Sensors, and the EventBus.

To create the EventBus resource, run:
{% highlight javascript %}
kubectl apply -f idp/core/tools/argo/events/sources/eventbus.yaml
{% endhighlight %}

By creating an EventBus, we have established a reliable and secure messaging system to facilitate the flow of events within our platform. EventSources, such as the Webhook we are going to create in the next section, will publish events to the EventBus. Sensors, which we will configure later, will subscribe to specific events and trigger the corresponding Argo Workflows.

## EventSource
The **[EventSource](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-events/concepts/event_source/)** resource specifies the configurations required to consume events from external sources, such as webhooks, and transform them into CloudEvents, a standardized format for describing event data. CloudEvents are then dispatched to the event bus for further processing. In our case, we are configuring a Webhook EventSource to listen for incoming HTTP requests on specific endpoints. This will allow us to trigger automated workflows based on events generated by developers interacting with FastAPI.

{% highlight javascript %}
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: EventSource
metadata:
  name: webhook
  namespace: argo-events
spec:
  eventBusName: eventbus-nats
  service:
    ports:
      - port: 12000
        targetPort: 12000
  webhook:
    // Defines the endpoints that will trigger events
    storage:
      port: "12000"
      endpoint: /storage
      method: POST
    compute:
      port: "12000"
      endpoint: /compute
      method: POST
    database:
      port: "12000"
      endpoint: /database
      method: POST
{% endhighlight %}

In this configuration:

- The EventSource is named **webhook** and resides in the argo-events namespace.
- It is associated with the **eventbus-nats** eventbus.
- The Webhook event source will listen on port 12000.
- The webhook section defines the specific endpoints that will trigger events:
  - **/storage:** This endpoint will trigger an event when an HTTP POST request is received, to provision Azure storage resources such as Blob storage accounts and File shares
  - **/compute:** This endpoint will trigger an event when an HTTP POST request is received, to provision Azure compute resources such as virtual machines, Kubernetes clusters.
  - **/database:** This endpoint will trigger an event when an HTTP POST request is received, to provision Azure database resources such as SQL databases, NoSQL databases, or caches.

By defining these endpoints, we have mapped specific API calls from FastAPI to corresponding events within Argo Events. These events will then be processed and used to trigger automated workflows, such as provisioning infrastructure, deploying applications, or configuring application settings, using Argo Workflows. This configuration seamlessly integrates our platform API with Argo Events, enabling event-driven automation.

To create the EventSource resource, run:
{% highlight javascript %}
kubectl apply -f idp/core/tools/argo/events/sources/eventsource.yaml
{% endhighlight %}

## Sensor
The **[Sensor](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-events/concepts/sensor/)**  defines a set of event dependencies (inputs) and triggers (outputs). It listens to events on the eventbus and acts as an event dependency manager to resolve and execute the triggers. A dependency is an event the sensor is waiting to happen. Based on the platform capabilities we described in **[Part 1](https://musana.engineering/platform-engineering-on-k8s-part1/)**, we are going to create the following Sensor resources in Argo Events.

- ### Compute Provisioning Sensor
The **compute-provision-sensor** listens for events from the **/compute** webhook endpoint and triggers an Argo Workflow named **compute-provision-workflow**. The workflow executes a series of steps to provision the requested resources using Terraform.

{% endhighlight %}
The parameters section defines how the **compute-provision-workflow** receives and maps input data from the webhook event triggered by the **compute-provision-sensor**. These parameters allow the workflow to dynamically configure itself based on the request payload received from the webhook. Additionally, they map the values from the webhook payload to the input variables that Terraform expects for provisioning the requested resources.
For example, the parameter:

{% highlight javascript %}
- src:
    dependencyName: webhook
    dataKey: body.region
  dest: spec.arguments.parameters.0.value
{% endhighlight %}

maps the value from the region field in the webhook payload's body to the first input parameter that Terraform expects for the **region** variable. This allows Terraform to provision the resources in the specified region based on the value provided by the developer through the webhook request.

- ### Compute Provisioning Workflow
The **compute-provision-workflow** is triggered by the **compute-provision-sensor** in response to events received from the **/compute** webhook endpoint. Upon receiving the event from the sensor, the workflow executes a series of steps to provision the requested resources using Terraform. The workflow follows these general stages:

- The workflow first validates the input parameters received from the webhook event, ensuring that all required information is provided, such as the cloud provider, resource type, region etc.
- Based on the requested resource type and cloud provider, the workflow retrieves the appropriate Terraform configuration files or modules from a centralized repository.
- The workflow initializes the Terraform working directory by downloading the required provider plugins and setting up the necessary backend configuration.
- Terraform performs a dry-run plan operation, generating an execution plan that outlines the changes required to provision the requested resources.
- Depending on the configuration, the workflow may include an approval step where manual intervention or approval is required before proceeding with the actual resource provisioning.
- If the plan is approved (or if approval is not required), the workflow executes the Terraform apply command, provisioning the requested resources in the specified cloud environment.
- Upon successful provisioning, the workflow generates output artifacts containing information about the provisioned resources, such as IP addresses, resource IDs, or connection details. Additionally, it can send notifications to the requesting developer or relevant stakeholders, informing them of the provisioning completion.
- Finally, the workflow cleans up any temporary files or directories used during the provisioning process.

In addition to the Compute Provisioning Sensor, we will create additional sensors as follows;

**Storage Provisioning Sensor:** This sensor listens for events from the **/storage** webhook endpoint and triggers an Argo Workflow named **storage-provision-workflow**. The workflow executes a series of steps to provision the requested storage resources using Terraform.

**Database Provisioning Sensor:** This Sensor listens for events from the **/database** webhook endpoint and triggers an Argo Workflow named **database-provision-workflow**. The workflow executes steps to provision the requested database resources using the database_config payload from the event.

To create all the sensors described above, run:
{% highlight javascript %}
kubectl apply -f idp/core/tools/argo/events/sensors
{% endhighlight %}
