In today's fast-paced software development landscape, organizations are constantly seeking ways to streamline their processes, enhance collaboration, and accelerate time-to-market. Enter Platform Engineering, a discipline that focuses on building toolchains and workflows that enable self-service capabilties for software engineering organizations within the cloud-native era.

In this multi-part series, we'll explore the practical implementation of Platform Engineering by building an internal developer platform (IDP) using powerful tools like Terraform, Argo Events, Argo Workflows, and FastAPI.

## The Vision: A Unified Developer Experience
Imagine a centralized platform where developers can call an api to provision and manage infrastructure, automate workflows, and build and deploy applications with ease. This platform would serve as a one-stop shop, eliminating the need for disparate tools and manual processes, ultimately reducing complexity and increasing productivity.

## Capabilities
Our internal developer platform will provide a comprehensive set of capabilities to streamline the software development lifecycle. Developers will be able to interact with the platform through Fast API endpoints, enabling them to provision resources, orchestrate workflows, and deploy applications with ease.

- **Infrastructure provisioning:** A developer can create a virtual machine in Azure or spin up a Kubernetes cluster in GCP for testing purposes, all through a simple API call or via the self-service Swagger interface.

- **Application Deployments:** A developer can trigger deployments based on various events, such as code commits or manual triggers, and the platform will orchestrate the entire deployment process, including building, testing, and rolling out the application to the desired environment.

## The Building blocks
Before diving into the implementation details, let's familiarize ourselves with the key tools and technologies that will power our Platform Engineering endeavor.

- **Kubernetes:** Kubernetes will serve as the underlying platform upon which various tools and components are integrated to create a comprehensive internal developer platform. 
- **Terraform:** Infrastructure as Code
Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that enables developers to provision and manage cloud resources across multiple providers, including AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. By defining infrastructure as code, Terraform ensures consistency, reproducibility, and version control, making it easier to collaborate and manage complex environments.
- **Argo Events:** Event-Driven Automation
Argo Events is a lightweight and highly extensible event-driven automation framework that enables developers to build and deploy event-driven applications. It seamlessly integrates with various event sources, such as Kubernetes resources, cloud services, and custom sources, allowing for efficient and scalable event processing.
- **Argo Workflows:** Orchestrating Complex Pipelines
Argo Workflows is a powerful workflow engine for Kubernetes that enables developers to orchestrate and manage complex parallel workflows. With its intuitive user interface and rich set of features, Argo Workflows simplifies the management of multi-step pipelines, ensuring reliable and consistent execution.
- **FastAPI:** Building Robust APIs
FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python. Its intuitive design, automatic data validation, and asynchronous support make it an ideal choice for building robust and scalable APIs that power the internal developer platform.
