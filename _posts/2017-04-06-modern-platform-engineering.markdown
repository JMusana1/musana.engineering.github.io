In today's fast-paced software development landscape, organizations are constantly seeking ways to streamline their processes, enhance collaboration, and accelerate time-to-market. Enter Platform Engineering, a discipline that focuses on building toolchains and workflows that enable self-service capabilties for software engineering organizations within the cloud-native era.

In this multi-part series, we'll explore the practical implementation of Platform Engineering by building an internal developer platform (IDP) using powerful tools like Terraform, Argo Events, Argo Workflows, and FastAPI.

## The Vision: A Unified Developer Experience
Imagine a centralized platform where developers can seamlessly provision and manage infrastructure, automate workflows, and build and deploy applications with ease. This platform would serve as a one-stop shop, eliminating the need for disparate tools and manual processes, ultimately reducing complexity and increasing productivity.
